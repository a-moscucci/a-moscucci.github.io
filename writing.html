        <h2>Biography</h2>
          <h3>Regional Manager: Kristina Fueyo</h3>
        <div class="story">
          <p>As regional manager of the Southeast office of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, Kristina Fueyo is in charge of event planning and volunteer outreach.</p>

            <p>Kristy first began working for NPH in July of 2012.  As a Marshall University graduate, Kristy has always been interested in non-profit work.</p>

            <p>As a child, she worked closely with her grandmother to raise funds for Project Smile, an organization that works to provide children’s toys to firefighters and police officers to give to children.  Later while she was at Miami Senior High, she worked in Camillus house and made an effort to volunteer in any area that she could.  While she was in college, she built a house for Habitat for Humanity, organized a walk for breast cancer awareness and created a free award winning international film festival.</p>

            <p>After graduating from university, Kristy began working for Charity Services Center in coral cables, an investment firm that gives donations to non-profits.  While she was working for CSC, she was asked to find a nonprofit that was close to her heart. After finding NPH and working hand in hand with it for six months, she realized that non-profit work was truly her passion and she wanted to take a leap and make a real difference. She says, “Ever since I was little, I was taught to help other people before I helped myself. Eventually, non profit work became a steady part of my life, and when I eventually began looking for jobs, I immediately knew that I wanted to incorporate non profit work into my professional career.”</p>

            <p>However, for Kristy, nothing will compare to the time she spend in the Dominican Republic NPH home. While there she had an experience that she will never forget. She met a young boy who was so overjoyed to spend time with the volunteers that at the end of her visit he gave her his hat and asked her to come back and visit soon.</p>

            <p>After that, Kristy knew she had made the right choice in becoming part of the NPH family.</p>

            <p>Currently living in Coral Gables with her husband Mike, Kristy enjoys cooking, crocheting, reading, painting and traveling, while she isn’t planning events and networking for NPH.</p>

        <h3>Paving a Pathway for Future Doctors</h3>
      <div class="story">
        <p>Amid the noontime din at the Jackson Memorial Hospital cafeteria, a group of young students eat lunch while chattering excitedly about their classes and their futures. They are not medical students—at least not yet—but the college juniors, seniors and recent graduates seem to blend in well with the physicians, medical students and dozens of hospital employees around them.</p>
        <p>In the years to come, these students could very well join the ranks of medicine, thanks to the program that has brought them to the Miller School this summer for a seven-week “mini med school experience.” The initiative, Minority Students in Health Careers Motivation Program, is one of the five programs that comprise the Miami Comprehensive Model for Health Professions Education, which, for more than three decades, has been providing underrepresented minority students with opportunities to develop the necessary skills to successfully compete for admission to schools in the medical field.</p>
        <p>The ultimate goal? To significantly increase diversity in the health and allied health professions, an ideal long supported by the coordinators, the Miller School’s Office for Diversity and Multicultural Affairs and Office of Medical Education, and the University of Miami’s Office of Academic Enrichment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Careers Opportunities Program provides funding.</p>
