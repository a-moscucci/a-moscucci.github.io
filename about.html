      <h2>Hi, my name is Alessandra Moscucci.</h2>
      <img src="img/me2.jpg" alt="picture of me">
      <p>I am currently a Junior at the University of Miami, with the intent to graduate in December 2015. I am an avid horseback rider who spends her weekends taking care of her horses and competing. Partying was never my favorite past time.  Instead, I focused on finding ways to put myself at the head of the heard. I became the Editor in Chief of my high school newspaper as a sophomore. As a senior, among the angst of applying to colleges and wondering about my future, I sought out a Location Scout and became her assistant, after realizing how much I loved the production world while I was on the beach with a horse for a music video. Eventually I was able to work on all kinds of production sets ranging from music videos to photo shoots for kids clothing.</p>

        <p>Having moved from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Miami as a teenager, I grew up with a different cultural background in comparison to my schoolmates. Because of this I believe that I have a unique cultural outlook that allows me to look at situations in multiple ways.  Now, as a young adult, I am continuously seeking opportunities that will help me gain knowledge and grow as an individual. </p>
